# Bones

Bones is a tiny customizable SCSS addon that includes very common style rules abstracted into CSS classes and SCSS mixins.
Inspired <sup>❤️</sup> by other boilerplates like <a href="http://getskeleton.com/">Skeleton</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/acahir/Barebones">Barebones</a> (both sadly abandoned).

This is a small *"upgrade"* on top of [**pure.css**](https://purecss.io) (but is completely separate) with the most common style rules.
Combining `normalize.css`, `pure.css` and `Bones` serves well as a starting point for pretty much any website, basic support for mobile included.
